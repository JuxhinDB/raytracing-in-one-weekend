# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Rust implementation

This is a pretty straight rewrite of the code from the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend]() in Rust.

Awesome book: cool results, clear explanations and surprisingly straight forward code.

Personally also a great way to try out Rust (more or less my first serious try, so sorry about the n00b style).
