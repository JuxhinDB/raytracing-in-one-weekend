This is a pretty straight rewrite of the code from the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.se/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html) in Rust.

Awesome book: cool results, clear explanations and surprisingly straight forward code.

Personally also a great way to try out Rust (more or less my first serious try, so sorry about the n00b style). I found looking at [jorendorff's implementation of the same book](https://github.com/jorendorff/rust-raytrace) very helpful.
